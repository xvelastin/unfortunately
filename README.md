# unfortunately
A little poem made from rejection emails from arts organisations.

To play, head to [**unfortunately, unfortunately**](https://xaviervelastin.com/interactive/unfortunately/unfortunately.html) for the latest version, or get it from the repo here. The code is commented up in case you're curious.

Feel free to fork, clone, edit and reupload with attribution to xavier velastin for the original idea, and let me know where it ends up.
